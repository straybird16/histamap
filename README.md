# README

This is the first website that I tried to develop. The concept is to visualize the human history from a geographical point of view, through the timeline divided into sub-timelines.

* Mostly realized by HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and Ruby

* Was a great experience in terms of designing a website/project from scratch and working alone
